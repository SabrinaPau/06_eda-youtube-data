## Objective
This repository contains an example EDA on daily statistics for trending YouTube videos.
You will go through the cleaning and feature engineering part of an EDA as well as the hypotheses making and testing part.
After going through this code-along you will have an idea about
- how to approach an EDA
- the single parts of an EDA
- what lines of code are commonly used within an EDA
- how to build and answer hypotheses

## Task
Open the repository in VS Code and activate your nf_base environment.
